/**
 * A `cm_value` structure represents values whose changes can be chained
 * and propagated to other values.
 *
 * They are useful when you want to update a value in regards to other values,
 * keeping it updated whenever these other values change. Their main use in
 * Creme is to create anchors that you can link your widgets to (say, link the
 * right edge of a widget to the left edge of another plus some offset).
 *
 * Every `cm_value` has a reduce function. They receive an array of all
 * of its upstream values and should produce a single value that is going to
 * be assigned to the `cm_value` and then offset by the offset value. Afterwards
 * downstream values will get updated.
 *
 * This means that if a `cm_value` has other values downstream, they will
 * have their reduce function called to update their values, going recursively
 * down the chain of linked values.
 *
 * Offsets are applied *after* values are calculated and this is done regardless
 * of the reduce function.
 *
 * If any update results in cyclical iteration, updates are stopped and a
 * message is printed in the `stderr` console. If you are interested in
 * debugging cyclical updates, compile creme with `-DCREME_DEBUG_UPDATE_CYCLE`
 * and cyclical updates will crash at an assertion.
 *
 * You should treat all members of this structure private, things can get real
 * messy if you don't.
